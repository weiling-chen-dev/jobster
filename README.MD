# Job Application Tracking App (MERN satck)

## Description

Welcome to my first full-stack practice project! This is a Job Application Tracking App made in React, Node.js framework and MongoDB. It allows users to create an account to easily add, delete, and update jobs the user applying for. With this App, users can manage their job applications, and understand a general review of their job seeking journey through simple and understandable chart.

## Front-End

- React
- Redux for stage management
- React Router handling single-page application routing
- Axios for HTTP requests

## Back-End

- Node.js
- Express middleware for building RESTful APIs with Node.js
- MongoDB as database for scaling and modifying data easily

## My Big Gotcha

- manage more complex but structured state by Redux
- manipulating data from the back end by using aggregation operations in mongodb
- use JSON Web Tokens and hashing password for securing data transfer
- Inherit Error class to customize errors
- Regular expressions for client input control

## Reference

Last but not least...
I would like to shout out to my online teacher John Smilga who designed the application, it's a really good practice(also a big project) to effectively learn building full-stack app.
